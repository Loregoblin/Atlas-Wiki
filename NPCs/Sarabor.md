Sarabor was a young lindwyrm,  living long the coast of [[Uthrein]]  when he meet his end to a rival. At his demise like many dragons he sent soul up to [[Avadon]]. His [[El-Kurin]] was then brought back down to Uthrein in the [[Ritual of the Crying Comet]]. [[Lady Grizalda]] then uses Sarabo;s El-Kurin to turn he into a [[Draconic Soul Tether]]. Sarabor relishes in his new form and uses his cunning to serve his Lady well while always looking for an opportunity to gain his freedom. 

Sarabor knows his fair share about the [[Dracku Cordum]]., and its workings, he will gladly give out information  to maintain his position while at the same time reporting back to to Lady Grizalda. 

Sarabor is intelligent enough to play both sides and cound be a great ally or enemy to the party.
