- Replaced [[Grashra]] as leader the the Teeth Tribe. 
- Lost at 9 years old, Knico is now 28. He knows the traditions of his people and was one of 5 Cinder Scales from the last clutch. The new Suzerain would have been chosen when he turned 14.  This was due to the last Suzerain becoming old and weak. 
- Came with  [[The Party]] Back to the Isle of Dread. 

- The Burning of Scales is the Rite of Passage that all Suzerain must pass. It involves the Cinder Scales Kneeing in a teepee of Flame Wood and it being lit a blazes. A Cinder Scale that remains until the teepee collapses has the right to claim Suzerain. If they don't complete the ritual in witness to members of the tribe their claim is rejected
