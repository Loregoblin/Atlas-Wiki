##### Emperor's Embrace

Emperor's Embrace (Costs 2 Actions): The Emperor fixes its gaze on one creature it can see. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become charmed.The charmed target obeys the Emperors commands. Emperor can communicate telepathically with the charmed target at a distance of up to 1 mile. If an order conflicts with a core value of a charmed creature the creature may choose to make a save.

After three successes, the creature is no longer charmed and immune to the effects of Emperors Embrace.

After three failures, the creatures identity is destroyed and becomes a vessel of the Emperor.

Additional rules

- Rolling a 1 counts as two failures

- Rolling a 20 counts as two successes

- Choosing to follow an order that conflicts with a core values counts as an automatic failure.

- Taking damage while charmed allows the creature to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Ending it in this way does not grant immunity and resets any successes or failures to zero.
